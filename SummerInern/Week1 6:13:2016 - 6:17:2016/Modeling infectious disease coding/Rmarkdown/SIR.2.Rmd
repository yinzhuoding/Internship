```{r cars}
## SIR model with demography
## It is the simple SIR epidemic without births or deaths

## Parameters:
# miu: Per captia death rate, and the population level birth rate;
# beta: Product of contact rates and transmission probability;
# gamma: Recovery Rate;
# S: Proportion of the population that are susceptible;
# I: Proportion of the population that are infectious;
# R: Proportion of the population that are recovered.

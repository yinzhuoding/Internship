```{r cars}
## It is the SICR which includes a carrier class.

## Parameters:
# miu: Per captia death rate, and the population level birth rate;
# beta: Product of contact rates and transmission probability;
# gamma: Recovery Rate;
# epsilon: Proportion reduction in transmission from carriers compared to standard infectious individuals;
# q: Proportion of infected individuals that become carriers rather than fully recover;
# Gamma: Recovery rate associated with carriers;
# S: Proportion of the population that are susceptible;
# I: Proportion of the population that are infectious;
# C: Proportion of the population that are carriers;
# R: Proportion of the population that are recovered.

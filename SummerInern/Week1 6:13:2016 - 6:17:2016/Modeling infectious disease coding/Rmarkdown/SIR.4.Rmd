---

```{r cars}
## It is the SIR model with a probability of mortality, and uneuqal births and deaths.
## This code assumes Frequency-Dependent Transmission

## Parameters:
# rho: The mortality probability;
# nu: The population level birth rate;
# miu: Per captia death rate, and the population level birth rate;
# beta: Product of contact rates and transmission probability;
# gamma: Recovery Rate;
# X: The number or density of susceptible individuals;
# Y: The number or density of infectious individuals;
# Z: The number or density of recovered individuals.

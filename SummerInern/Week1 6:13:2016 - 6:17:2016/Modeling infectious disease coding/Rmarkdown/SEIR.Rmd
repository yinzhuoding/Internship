```{r cars}
## It is the SEIR epidemic with equal births and deaths.
## Note we no-longer explicitly model the recovered class.

## Parameters:
# miu: Per captia death rate, and the population level birth rate;
# beta: Product of contact rates and transmission probability;
# gamma: Recovery Rate;
# sigma: The rate at which individuals move from the exposed to the infectious class;
# S: Proportion of the population that are susceptible;
# E: Proportion of the population that are exposed;
# I: Proportion of the population that are infectious;
# R: Proportion of the population that are recovered.

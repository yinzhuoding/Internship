The potential rapid availability of large-scale clinical episode data during the next influenza pandemic suggests an opportunity for increasing the speed with which novel pathogens can be characterized. Key intervention decisions will be determined by both the transmissibility of the  novel strain (measured by the basic reproductive number $R_0$) and its individual-level severity. The 2009 pandemic illustrated that estimating individual-level severity, as described by the proportion $p_C$ of infections that result in clinical cases, can remain uncertain for a prolonged period of time.

\title{
	Prints information about a W-T modeling of the 2003 SARS data
	}
\description{
Prints to screen and to a file information about a W-T run for a given country using the 2003 SARS data.  Information includes user name, date and time of run, information on the machine, direcotry where job is running and directory where all the data and plots will be saved. 
}
\usage{
	success <- print.wt.info(mydata=mydata,shape=shape,scale=scale,ireal=ireal,subDir=subDir,log=logfile)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{mydata}{
  	A list with an array of case numbers, an array of onset or report day for these cases, total number of cases and country name.
  	}
  \item{shape}{
  	The shape parameter for a Weibull distribution, defualt is: 3.8
  }
  \item{scale}{
  	The scale parameter for a Weibull distribution, defualt is: 8.4
  }
  \item{ireal}{
  How many realizations of R(t) to calculate, default is 10,000
  }
  \item{subDir}{
  	Name of directory where output and plots are saved
  }
  \item{log}{
  	Name of log file for this run
  }
}
